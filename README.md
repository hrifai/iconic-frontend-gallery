# Iconic-Frontend-Challenge

This project is a Frontend Technical Challenge. The task was to create a gallery/catalog page that could be used to view, search and filter products. The data for this would come from an external public API that has been provided.

This project implements getting the data, filtering the data by search, gender, and allows for sorting by various categories. It also implements basic front-end caching to aviod repetitive calls to the backend
